# TheGamingRoom
Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
-The Gamming Room was requesting a game be made that roughly followed the rules of Pictionary, but hosted online. Users would be able to play the game in a browser on their computer. For software requirements, they need a web client developed for the game that would run smoothly and be able to access a library of 200 ~8GB images and not have any lag or perfomance hangups.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
-I think I did particularly well and describing the game beyond the informatin given. A lot of factors go into developing a game like this, even though it may seem simple on its face.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
-The flow-charts provided as well as all the flow chart examples in the text book were very helpful.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-I would revise with version numbering. It is still at version 1.00. I should have updated it every time I finished a new section. The final version should be 1.03.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-If aren't considering the user's needs while designing what are you even doing? The entire point of designing something that is user-friendly and can meet certain desgin constraints and requirements. It may be a really well-written bit of code, but if the UI runs clunky or doesn't meet the user's needs it will not be successful. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
-I apporached it very straight-forward. Get code down fast and see if it runs. Review and debug until it does. Once it runs, go back thorugh it again and see why its really bad and fix it, possibly consult textbooks or other online resources in this step. Rinse. Repeat until you are satisfied (or hit your deadline).
